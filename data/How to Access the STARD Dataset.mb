📘 How to Access the STAR*D Dataset

The data used in this project come from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) clinical study, conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
Due to ethical and privacy considerations, the raw data are not publicly available and must be requested directly from the authorized repository.

🔹 Steps to Request Access

Visit the NIMH Data Archive (NDA)
 — Study ID: 2337 — "Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D)".

Create an account on the NDA platform (if you do not already have one).

Submit a Data Access Request (DAR) specifying:

The intended use of the data (e.g., academic research, reproducibility study, or clinical modeling);

Your institutional affiliation;

The project title and description (you may reference this repository as part of your research context).

Once approved, you will receive instructions for securely downloading the dataset through the NDA portal.

🔹 Ethical and Legal Considerations

Access to the STAR*D dataset requires agreement with the NIMH Data Use Certification (DUC), which restricts redistribution of the data.

Do not upload or share the raw dataset in any public repository or supplementary materials.

Ensure all analyses comply with data protection regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, or LGPD, depending on your jurisdiction.

When publishing results based on STAR*D data, always cite the original study:

Rush, A. J., et al. (2004). Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D): Rationale and design. Controlled Clinical Trials, 25(1), 119–142. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0197-2456(03)00112-0

🔹 Example Citation for Derived Work

If you preprocess, clean, or transform the dataset for this project, please include a statement such as:

“This work uses data obtained from the NIMH Data Archive (Study ID: 2337 — STAR*D). The dataset was accessed under an approved Data Use Certification (DUC). All analyses were conducted in accordance with NDA policies and data privacy regulations.”

✅ Tip:
For reproducibility, you may include a data_preparation.py script in your repository, showing the preprocessing pipeline, but never the raw data files themselves (e.g., .csv, .tsv, .sav).
