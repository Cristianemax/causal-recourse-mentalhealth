🧠 How to Access the STAR*D Dataset

The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) dataset is a large, multi-phase clinical study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
It contains demographic, clinical, and psychometric information from approximately 4,000 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Because the dataset includes sensitive clinical data, it is not publicly available. Researchers must request access directly from the NIMH Data Archive (NDA).

🔐 Access Instructions

To obtain access to the STAR*D dataset, follow these steps:

Visit the NIMH Data Archive (NDA)
.

Log in using an existing NDA account or create a new one.

In the search bar, type:
“STAR*D - Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (PDS000001)”.

Open the study page and click “Request Access”.

Complete the Data Access Request (DAR) form, describing your research purpose and how you intend to use the dataset.

Wait for approval from the NIMH Data Access Committee.

Once approved, download the dataset in .CSV or .SAS format.

Place the files in the data/ directory of this repository.

Update your environment path or configuration file to point to the local dataset location.

⚠️ Ethical notice:
The STAR*D dataset contains sensitive information related to mental health and patient treatment outcomes.
Before using the data, ensure compliance with all applicable regulations — including the LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law) and the GDPR (European Union General Data Protection Regulation).

⚙️ Data Overview

The STAR*D dataset includes:

Demographic information (age, gender, education, marital status);

Clinical evaluations (HAM-D, QIDS, and other depression severity scales);

Treatment information across multiple phases;

Psychometric and cognitive test scores;

Family and substance use history.

This diversity of variables allows both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, supporting advanced predictive modeling in mental health.
✅ Tip:
For reproducibility, you may include a data_preparation.py script in your repository, showing the preprocessing pipeline, but never the raw data files themselves (e.g., .csv, .tsv, .sav).
